# ðŸ”Œ Resistors (R)

### 1. **What is a Resistor?**

* A resistor is a **passive electronic component** that **opposes (resists) the flow of electric current**.
* It converts electrical energy into **heat**.
* Symbol: `â”€/\/\/\â”€` or a rectangle `â”€â–­â”€`.

### 2. **Basic Formula**

Ohmâ€™s Law:

$$
R = \frac{V}{I}
$$

* **R** = Resistance (Î©, Ohms)
* **V** = Voltage (Volts)
* **I** = Current (Amps)

### 3. **Key Properties**

* **Resistance value:** Measured in ohms (Î©).
* **Tolerance:** Accuracy of value (e.g., Â±5%).
* **Power rating:** How much heat it can handle (e.g., Â¼ W, 1 W, 5 W).
* **Temperature coefficient:** How resistance changes with temperature.

### 4. **Types of Resistors**

1. **Fixed Resistors**

   * Carbon film
   * Metal film
   * Wire-wound
2. **Variable Resistors (Potentiometers, Rheostats)**

   * Used for volume controls, tuning, brightness.
3. **Special Resistors**

   * **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor):** Changes resistance with light.
   * **NTC/PTC Thermistors:** Change resistance with temperature.
   * **Varistor (MOV):** Protects circuits from voltage spikes.

### 5. **Resistor Color Code**

* 4-band or 5-band code used to read resistance values.
  Example: **Red, Violet, Brown, Gold â†’ 270 Î© Â±5%**

---

### 6. **Resistor in Circuits**

* **Series:**

  $$
  R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 ...
  $$
* **Parallel:**

  $$
  \frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ...
  $$

### 7. **Applications**

* Limit current (e.g., for LED protection).
* Voltage divider (splits voltage).
* Pull-up / Pull-down resistors in digital circuits.
* Biasing of transistors.
* Heat generation (load resistors, dummy loads).

---

### 8. **Advanced Concepts**

* **SMD Resistors:** Tiny surface-mounted types for modern electronics.
* **Precision Resistors:** Very accurate (used in measurement).
* **High-power Resistors:** For motors, heaters, power supplies.
* **Network Resistors (SIP/DIP):** Multiple resistors in one package.
* **Non-linear resistors:** Varistors, thermistors (resistance changes with conditions).
